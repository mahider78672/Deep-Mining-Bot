# Deep-Mining-Bot

Deep-Mining-Bot is an AI-powered document mining bot built using Python and FastAPI. It processes PDF documents uploaded by the developer and allows users to ask topic-specific questions through the UI. If the question is relevant to the documentâ€™s content, the bot provides an answer; otherwise, it denies the request.

Features
PDF Processing: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs
Vector Embeddings & RAG: Enhances response accuracy
FastAPI Backend: Ensures high-performance API responses
Question Filtering: Only allows responses related to the document's field
Next.js Frontend (Planned): Interactive UI for user queries
Technologies Used
Python (Core Development)
FastAPI (Backend Framework)
LangChain (For RAG Implementation)
FAISS / ChromaDB (Vector Database for embeddings)
LLM (e.g., GPT-2 or Open-Source Model) (For intelligent responses)
PyMuPDF / pdfplumber (PDF text extraction)
Next.js (Planned) (Frontend UI)
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or later
